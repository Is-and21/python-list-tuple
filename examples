# Case Study: Employee Attendance Management System

## Objective

Build a simple Employee Attendance System using lists and tuples in Python.

## Problem Statement

A company wants to track employee attendance using Python. The system should:

- Store employee records (ID, Name, Department).
- Mark attendance (Present/Absent) for each employee.
- Allow searching for attendance records by employee ID.
- Display a summary of attendance.

**Employee Details Tuple**

```python
(employee_id, employee_name, department)
```

**Attenance Records**

This will be a list of tuples.
```python
[(employee_id, date, status), ...]
```

### Tasks

- Create functions to mark attendance, search for attendance by id

### Sample Data

```python
attendance_records = [
    (101, "2025-03-01", "Present"),
    (102, "2025-03-01", "Absent"),
    (103, "2025-03-01", "Present"),
    (104, "2025-03-01", "Present"),
    (105, "2025-03-01", "Absent"),
]

employees = [
    (101, "Alice Johnson", "HR"),
    (102, "Bob Smith", "IT"),
    (103, "Charlie Brown", "Finance"),
    (104, "David White", "IT"),
    (105, "Eve Black", "Marketing")
]

```

### Sample Output

```
Attendance marked for Employee 101: Present
Attendance marked for Employee 102: Present
Attendance marked for Employee 103: Absent
Attendance marked for Employee 104: Present
Attendance marked for Employee 105: Present

Searching Attendance for Employee ID 102:
Date: 2025-03-01, Status: Absent
Date: 2025-03-02, Status: Present

Attendance Summary:
Alice Johnson: 100.00% Present
Bob Smith: 50.00% Present
Charlie Brown: 50.00% Present
David White: 100.00% Present
Eve Black: 50.00% Present
```



code:

attendance_records = [(101,"2025-03-01","Present"),(102,"2025-03-01","Abscent"),(103,"2025-03-01","Present"),(104,"2025-03-01","Present"),(105,"2025-03-01","Abscent")]


 def search_emp(emp_list, status):
     for emp in emp_list:
         if emp[2] == status:
             return emp
         return "Not found"
 print(search_emp(attendance_records,"Present"))

employees = [(101,"Alice","HR"),(102,"Bob","IT"),(103,"Charlie","Finance"),(104,"David","IT"),(105,"Eve","Finance")]


def search_emp(emp_list, status):
    for emp in emp_list:
        if emp[0] == status:
            return emp
        return "Not found"
print(search_emp(employees,105))
